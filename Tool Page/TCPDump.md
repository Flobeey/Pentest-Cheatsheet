#### Basic Capture Options

Below is a table of basic Tcpdump switches we can use to modify how our captures run. These switches can be chained together to craft how the tool output is shown to us in STDOUT and what is saved to the capture file. This is not an exhaustive list, and there are many more we can use, but these are the most common and valuable.

| **Switch Command** | **Result**                                                                                                         |

|          i         | Selects an interface to capture from. ex. -i eth0                                                                  |

|         nn         | Do not resolve hostnames or well-known ports.                                                                      |
|          e         | Will grab the ethernet header along with upper-layer data.                                                         |
|          X         | Show Contents of packets in hex and ASCII.                                                                         |
|         XX         | Same as X, but will also specify ethernet headers. (like using Xe)                                                 |
|     v, vv, vvv     | Increase the verbosity of output shown and saved.                                                                  |
|          c         | Grab a specific number of packets, then quit the program.                                                          |
|          s         | Defines how much of a packet to grab.                                                                              |
|          S         | change relative sequence numbers in the capture display to absolute sequence numbers. (13248765839 instead of 101) |
|          q         | Print less protocol information.                                                                                   |
|     r file.pcap    | Read from a file.                                                                                                  |
|     w file.pcap    | Write into a file                                                                                                  |
